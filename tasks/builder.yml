# We create a link from /usr/bin/python3 to $HOME/.local/bin/python
# This means that "python" will now point to "python3" and not "python2"
# This is essentially the same as removing the python2-minimal package
# which is not needed by default in ubuntu 18.04
# And it also allows us to compile GRASS without creating virtualenvs
# Your mileage may vary though...
# TODO if we end up using a virtualenv, we will probably have to do
